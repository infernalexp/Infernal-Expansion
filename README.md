# How to run

Requirements:

Java 8

IntelliJ IDEA


when installing IntelliJ, make sure you added the launchers to PATH

download the folder, unzip it to a chosen location.

Open IntelliJ and select 'open'

navigate to your chosen folder and select 'build.gradle'

Open it as a project.

You will have to build the project, this can take a while if you are on a slow computer (took me half an hour)

Once you have opened it in IntelliJ, open the terminal. This can be found on the bottom left, and once you click it a small terminal should pop up.

Here, type 'gradlew genIntellijRuns'

wait for that to complete

navigate to the file named InfernalExpansion.java in intelliJ and double click it to open it.

select the button named 'edit configurations' in the top right. you should be taken to a page with two options on the left: Application and templates

select application, and from the options that appear select 'run client'

press the 'okay' button.

return to the project and click the green arrow in the top left

enjoy!
